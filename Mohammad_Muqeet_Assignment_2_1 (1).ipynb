            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus and a gripping, unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.The acting performances in this film are truly as great as they come. Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

            "It's going to be incredibly hard to top this masterpiece! This Batman movie out of ALL the Batman movies ever made is #1 to me and it is not even close! I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus and a gripping, unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.The acting performances in this film are truly as great as they come. Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it.

The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger).

It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level.

It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

            "It's going to be incredibly hard to top this masterpiece! This Batman movie out of ALL the Batman movies ever made is #1 to me and it is not even close! I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles.

            "It's going to be incredibly hard to top this masterpiece! This Batman movie out of ALL the Batman movies ever made is #1 to me and it is not even close! I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger).

It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel.

The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus and a gripping, unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.The acting performances in this film are truly as great as they come. Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it.

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus and a gripping, unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.The acting performances in this film are truly as great as they come. Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker. The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature. It raises philosophical questions about morality, justice, and the consequences of one's choices.

            "The Dark Knight is a masterpiece of the superhero genre, a dark and complex crime saga that transcends its comic book origins.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it.

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus and a gripping, unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.The acting performances in this film are truly as great as they come. Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker. The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout.

            "The Dark Knight is a masterpiece of the superhero genre, a dark and complex crime saga that transcends its comic book origins.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that.

While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it.

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

            "The Dark Knight is a masterpiece of the superhero genre, a dark and complex crime saga that transcends its comic book origins.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

            "The Dark Knight is a masterpiece of the superhero genre, a dark and complex crime saga that transcends its comic book origins.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker. The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions. Bale's performance adds a layer of vulnerability to Batman, making him more relatable and human.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's commitment to the role, coupled with his chillingly charismatic delivery, elevates the character to new heights. The Joker's anarchic philosophy and sadistic sense of humor make him one of the most compelling and memorable villains in cinematic history. Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist.

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist.

            "The film's success is mainly due to its complex narrative and rich character development. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

            "Where do I even begin. First of all this movie has the best plot and the best characters in cinema history. Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist. Seriously this is a movie where you dont even think about checking the time on your phone because you are literally soooo invested in the story.\n",

            "The film's success is mainly due to its complex narrative and rich character development. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense.

            "The film's success is mainly due to its complex narrative and rich character development. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life.

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Heath Ledger's unforgettable portrayal of the Joker is simply sublime. His performance is so convincing and disturbing that it truly makes you question the nature of good and evil. Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances. Christian Bale perfectly embodies the tormented Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. The chemistry between Bale and Ledger on screen is palpable, and every scene between the two is electrifying.The plot is masterfully crafted, full of unexpected twists and moments of great intensity.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Heath Ledger's unforgettable portrayal of the Joker is simply sublime. His performance is so convincing and disturbing that it truly makes you question the nature of good and evil. Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Masterfully directed by Christopher Nolan, this film not only redefines what a comic book movie can achieve but also transcends the expectations of the general audience.From the very first moment the movie begins, I was completely immersed in its dark and suspenseful world. Heath Ledger's unforgettable portrayal of the Joker is simply sublime. His performance is so convincing and disturbing that it truly makes you question the nature of good and evil. Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances. Christian Bale perfectly embodies the tormented Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. The chemistry between Bale and Ledger on screen is palpable, and every scene between the two is electrifying.The plot is masterfully crafted, full of unexpected twists and moments of great intensity.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Masterfully directed by Christopher Nolan, this film not only redefines what a comic book movie can achieve but also transcends the expectations of the general audience.From the very first moment the movie begins, I was completely immersed in its dark and suspenseful world. Heath Ledger's unforgettable portrayal of the Joker is simply sublime. His performance is so convincing and disturbing that it truly makes you question the nature of good and evil. Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances. Christian Bale perfectly embodies the tormented Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. The chemistry between Bale and Ledger on screen is palpable, and every scene between the two is electrifying.The plot is masterfully crafted, full of unexpected twists and moments of great intensity. The duality between Batman and the Joker is explored in a fascinating way, and the film raises profound questions about human nature and morality.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met.

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker. The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions. Bale's performance adds a layer of vulnerability to Batman, making him more relatable and human.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's commitment to the role, coupled with his chillingly charismatic delivery, elevates the character to new heights. The Joker's anarchic philosophy and sadistic sense of humor make him one of the most compelling and memorable villains in cinematic history. Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on.

I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie.

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him.

Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met.

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie.

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Masterfully directed by Christopher Nolan, this film not only redefines what a comic book movie can achieve but also transcends the expectations of the general audience.From the very first moment the movie begins, I was completely immersed in its dark and suspenseful world. Heath Ledger's unforgettable portrayal of the Joker is simply sublime. His performance is so convincing and disturbing that it truly makes you question the nature of good and evil. Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met.

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

            "It's going to be incredibly hard to top this masterpiece! This Batman movie out of ALL the Batman movies ever made is #1 to me and it is not even close! I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker. The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature. It raises philosophical questions about morality, justice, and the consequences of one's choices.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

            "It's going to be incredibly hard to top this masterpiece! This Batman movie out of ALL the Batman movies ever made is #1 to me and it is not even close! I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre.

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker.

It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger).

It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles.

            "It's going to be incredibly hard to top this masterpiece! This Batman movie out of ALL the Batman movies ever made is #1 to me and it is not even close! I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger).

It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel.

The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene.\n",

            "Plot: 9.7/10 The Joker has taken over Gotham City and does it in the most intense and interesting way possible. While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger).

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

            "I love these triologies. The best ever, ever! From the cinematography, the music score to the story telling absolutely brilliant. It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

            "The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus and a gripping, unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.The acting performances in this film are truly as great as they come. Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger).

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

Heath Ledgers infamous take on the Joker is undoubtedly one of the most captivating, disturbing, and iconic villain performances in film history. All of the other main players in the film (especially Batman, Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Gordon) are also acted remarkably well, due in part to the immense strength of the film's cast.Overall the Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the last century and an essential film experience, even for those who are not fans of the superhero genre. It is legendary for a reason.\n",

            "The film is a thrilling and complex exploration of the thin line between justice and chaos, anchored by an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger as the iconic Joker.Nolan's vision is evident from the opening sequence, a bank heist masterfully orchestrated by the Joker.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced.

To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well.

Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before.

Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker.

And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix.

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions. Bale's performance adds a layer of vulnerability to Batman, making him more relatable and human.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's commitment to the role, coupled with his chillingly charismatic delivery, elevates the character to new heights. The Joker's anarchic philosophy and sadistic sense of humor make him one of the most compelling and memorable villains in cinematic history. Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist.

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10.

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions. Bale's performance adds a layer of vulnerability to Batman, making him more relatable and human.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's commitment to the role, coupled with his chillingly charismatic delivery, elevates the character to new heights.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

            "Where do I even begin. First of all this movie has the best plot and the best characters in cinema history. Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

            "I just really don't think there can be any debate about this. I suppose you can't say it's stood the test of time, but then again, it has been almost sixteen years. Even, though I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Batman', it still doesn't come close to trumping 'The Dark Knight', and I honestly don't think any Batman movie ever will, and that's because of one thing... Heath Ledger's Joker.Heath embodied a Joker we had never seen before. As an agent of chaos, he showed why he will always be the ultimate nemesis to Batman. The unstoppable force (Joker) vs the immovable object (Batman), destined to battle for eternity.Christian Bale, along with the rest of the ensemble cast were also simply perfect. Christopher Nolan, is probably my personal favourite director of all time, and this film is one of the big reasons why. Hans Zimmer also delivers an unforgettable score.I recently had the absolute pleasure to show this masterpiece to a friend, which for whatever obscene reason had never seen it before. He was totally blown away; almost to the extent of having half your face melted off.\n",

            "Where do I even begin. First of all this movie has the best plot and the best characters in cinema history. Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist. Seriously this is a movie where you dont even think about checking the time on your phone because you are literally soooo invested in the story.\n",

            "The film's success is mainly due to its complex narrative and rich character development. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well.

Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience.

            "Where do I even begin. First of all this movie has the best plot and the best characters in cinema history. Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist.

            "The film's success is mainly due to its complex narrative and rich character development. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films.

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions. Bale's performance adds a layer of vulnerability to Batman, making him more relatable and human.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's commitment to the role, coupled with his chillingly charismatic delivery, elevates the character to new heights. The Joker's anarchic philosophy and sadistic sense of humor make him one of the most compelling and memorable villains in cinematic history. Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

            "The film's success is mainly due to its complex narrative and rich character development. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of iconic, a performance that earned him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, unpredictable and utterly mesmerizing. His nuanced and chilling performance elevates the film beyond the confines of a typical superhero movie, making it a psychological thriller that explores the thin line between order and anarchy. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his performance is as compelling as ever. The character's internal struggle is palpable as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of being a symbol of justice in a city plagued by corruption.\n",

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances.

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere.

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through.Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action.Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good.Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film.Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time.Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair.Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome. You can watch this movie so many times and catch new things you didn't see before.Overall: 9.65/10.\n",

It brings to life realism on how this could actually be, how one could actually go through such trauma and be left with such wealth and dedicate their time hunting and taking on crime with a hollywood twist of course but a sense of realism to it more than fiction which is crazy for a super hero movie. And sounds nuts my even mentioning it but he did a GREAT job. Christian Bale as the Batman is soo epic, with the new guy as Batman in the latest batman is good for a back story, instead of vengeance being hope, love that but christian still finishes it off well. Sucks that he isnt the new batman. Love also how christian bale takes on the role as his own so well. Further, the new batman kind of contradicts the story a bit I didnt like that but I love how Nolan's triology tells this awesome super hero story.\n",

The film immediately establishes a tone of tension and unpredictability that persists throughout. Gotham City is depicted as a gritty and corrupt metropolis on the brink, plagued by organized crime and a desperate need for a savior.Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, embodying the character with a brooding intensity. The film delves deeper into the psychological toll of being a masked vigilante, exploring the internal struggles of Wayne as he grapples with the consequences of his actions. Bale's performance adds a layer of vulnerability to Batman, making him more relatable and human.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's commitment to the role, coupled with his chillingly charismatic delivery, elevates the character to new heights. The Joker's anarchic philosophy and sadistic sense of humor make him one of the most compelling and memorable villains in cinematic history. Ledger posthumously received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a testament to the impact of his performance.The film's moral complexity is exemplified through the character of Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. The transformation of the charismatic district attorney into the vengeful and disfigured Two-Face is a tragic and thought-provoking narrative arc. It challenges the notion of heroism and explores the corrupting influence of chaos on even the noblest intentions.Nolan's direction is masterful, utilizing practical effects and immersive cinematography to create a visually stunning experience. The action sequences, including the now-iconic chase scenes, are choreographed with precision and intensity. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, further enhances the atmosphere, contributing to the overall immersive experience.\"The Dark Knight\" is not merely a superhero film; it's a crime drama and a character study that delves into the complexities of human nature.

            "Gotham creates one villain and attracts another. For one reason or another, all citizens feel like they need to stay in that hell. Batman keeps running his inherited skyriser board business. Nobody move. Perfect. The Joker robs a bank, and is going to burn a 10 foot high pile of banknotes. Which doesn't make sense because the remaining banknotes would just deflate. The Joker would have to target the gold reserves. The Bank can just print new bank notes once the Joker is done. Still, the banknote burning nonsense is dwarved by the nonsensical citizens of Gotham - Who actually choose to live there.\n",

            "Watching this film was an experience I'll never forget and definitely worth all the oscars it got. Christopher Nolan has done it AGAIN. Christian Bale has never failed to disappoint me, his acting is amazing. And he also looks like batman, if that makes sense... I've watched a lot of different Batmans in action and Christian is my favourite out of all of them. But someone who amazed me and maybe stood out even more than Bale, was Heath Ledger. This man is so incredibly good at acting that you even forget he is acting. He has done a wonderful job being the Joker. I prefer him to Joaquin Phoenix. These 3 people created the best comic book movie ever.\n",

            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie. And, conversely (as SCTV's Joe Flaherty would say during a Charlton Heston impersonation) during those stretches in which I was reminded it was a superhero movie, I didn't wish it wasn't.Because, trust me, as I made my way to the screening I was feeling well and truly sick of superhero movies. I'm not a guy-or for that matter a critic-who believes or has ever believed in genre hierarchies, but I don't know, maybe my aesthetic arteries are hardening-entertaining arguments about the value/meaning of the likes of Hancock is increasingly making me (metaphorically) throw up my hands and say, \"For feck's sake, guys, this isn't Stalker or The Red and the White or Kanal or Satantango or Muriel or what ever we're talking about here, it's a commitedly vulgar frickin' superhero movie that's been cut to shreds the better to flatter/insult its target audience.\" Come on. Can we at least pretend we're adults for 20 minutes or so? Apparently not, is what I'm thinking much of the past few weeks, entertaining dark thoughts about how if what 1968 embodied was a cultural explosion, what 2008 is building up to is an implosion into a state of permanent cultural adolescence. All the whackedness concerning that New Yorker cover is bad enough, but for me a nadir was achieved Tuesday afternoon, at the Carroll Gardens magazine stand that's closing down at my subway stop (the better to make way for the construction of some too-tall apartment building), glimpsing this month's Details and its cover line \"James McAvoy Made Out With Angelina Jolie And You Didn't.\"\n",

            "The Dark Knight is a movie certainly a movie I enjoyed watching, and I can see why someone would rate this 10/10, but it has a few issues keeping me from giving it that high.Bruce Wayne just doesn't resonate as an interesting protagonist. His personality can be boiled down to \"i'm batman' at the end of the day. Normally this would completely destroy a movie but luckily every other character is extremely well written and interesting. The Joker while not my favourite interpretation is a very good antagonist. He has some serious effects on the world and the movie does a good, if not too far in some places job of showing how threatening it is. I really enjoyed how the final confrontation with him was more ideological than physical with his belief of \"Anyone can become as evil as him given the right circumstances\" being proven wrong when neither boat presses the buttons. However the major issue with this is that Harvey Dent still stays as a villain, and is not redeemed. While I enjoyed the actors performance and personality think Two-Face is one of the best DC villains, I think the movie would be better without him. The themes of the movie get really conflicted if it's both \"The Joker is wrong in his beliefs because the boats didn't blow eachother up\" AND \"The Joker is right because Harvey Dent was corrupted.\".\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight\", directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that transcends typical superhero movie expectations and delivers a compelling narrative about morality, chaos, and heroism.Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne is nuanced and complex, effectively capturing the internal struggle of a man burdened by his dual identity.

            "As a movie enthusiast, I can confidently say that \"The Dark Knight\" is a masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the superhero genre. Masterfully directed by Christopher Nolan, this film not only redefines what a comic book movie can achieve but also transcends the expectations of the general audience.From the very first moment the movie begins, I was completely immersed in its dark and suspenseful world. Heath Ledger's unforgettable portrayal of the Joker is simply sublime. His performance is so convincing and disturbing that it truly makes you question the nature of good and evil. Ledger manages to create an iconic villain who is terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.In addition to Ledger's impressive work, the entire cast delivers standout performances. Christian Bale perfectly embodies the tormented Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. The chemistry between Bale and Ledger on screen is palpable, and every scene between the two is electrifying.The plot is masterfully crafted, full of unexpected twists and moments of great intensity. The duality between Batman and the Joker is explored in a fascinating way, and the film raises profound questions about human nature and morality. Furthermore, the cinematography is stunning, with incredibly choreographed action sequences and grim urban landscapes that perfectly reflect the tone of the story.Another highlight of \"The Dark Knight\" is its musical score. Hans Zimmer's music perfectly complements the tense and thrilling atmosphere of the film, further elevating the cinematic experience.In summary, \"The Dark Knight\" is much more than a superhero movie; it is an epic thriller that challenges the conventions of the genre and leaves the viewer pondering even after the credits roll. It is a cinematic experience not to be missed and one that will remain relevant and thrilling for many years to come.\n",

            "This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.\n",

            "\"The Dark Knight,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, \"The Dark Knight\" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\n",

            "Characters with depth, tragic climax and anticlimax.Christian Bale's performance is subtle and dark, despite the off putting voice he was instructed to use.Heath Ledger's gives the performance of a lifetime, even though his own was not that long.The use of film with the slight noir elements gave it a very cinematic drama look.Most characters were pretty colourful. Gordon had his role deeply submerged in the tragic conflict between the Joker, Batman and Two Face.Harvey Dent's character follows Joker's plan very convincingly and has a darkly righteous twist.Not an original observation, but the boat scene was poetic.The pace is a bit fast and lacks atmosphere. Still a great film!\n",

            "Even four years after is original release, The Dark Knight casts a pretty big shadow. Not only is it the best Batman movie ever produced, and easily one of the best stories to feature the character in any medium, it's also a wonderful piece of cinema on its own terms. Christopher Nolan is an astounding craftsman, and one who constructed his superhero sequel without ever feeling the need to dumb down. The Dark Knight is a wonderfully effective and stunningly constructed piece of popcorn cinema, but it's also the most profound and engaging (and, importantly, even-handed) meditations on the War of Terror that Hollywood has produced. It's bold and accessible, but it's also intelligent and engaging. More than an astoundingly impressive blockbuster, it's just a superb piece of cinema.\n",

I can only imagine if Heath Ledger didn't pass away, how The Dark Knight Rises would have turned out with Tom Hardy as Bane! Woo! Talk about a tag team that any superhero would not want to face! It really captured the dark side of Batman like the current comics and video games. It was almost to the point where you felt it was real, like it could happen in real life. In this film I was partial to the Joker. He was mysterious, meticulous, ruthless, charming, and a menace all at once. That alone is spooky.\n",

            "This movie was one that was just a little too unbelievable for me. I've never been a major superhero fan and saying that this is easily my favourite of the few I've seen. I found the Joker scenes to be incredible and if it was all him I'd have given this higher. The whole character of Joker and the aroma around him was something I really enjoyed across this movie. I did unfortunately find the parts with Batman a little too out there. This movie also wrapped itself up brilliantly for me as I had very few questions once the conclusion was met. Quite good for me but not at the great section purely because it just isn't my scene."
